# Schachtman-Lab-NGS
Data analysis method

Root exudation is pivotal for plants to cope with the changing environment through interacting with the soil organisms. 16S rRNA amplicon next generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool to understand how root exudate compound affect the mrobial composition in the root, rhizosphere and soil. Here we show the data analysis method Schachtman lab developed by using different packages in R, combined with Qiime v1.9.1 and USEARCH v10.
